   <h2> What is Gastona</h2>

   <p>
      Gastona is an open source scripting language for quick development of applications.
      It is available in Windows, Linux, Raspberry Pi for desktop applications
      and as Android App. This means that it is possible to write a gastona script and run
      it in all this platforms without any modification.
   </p>

   <h2> Is Gastona different ?</h2>

   <p>
      A main design goal of Gastona is to minimize as much as possible the programming effort when
      creating applications. For example the simplistic idea "a button is a button" applies
      when building the a Graphic User Interface (GUI). Also the commands try to be as much "high level"
      as possible to do more with less.
   </p>

   <p>
      This pragmatic approach makes that gastona scripts does not look like any known programming language.
      Actually it is something more between a smart configurator and a programming language.
      The best way to learn it is to run gastona for desktop (gastona.jar) which comes with
      a complete documentation of the language, widgets and commands. Almost every documented element
      has one or several sample related scripts that can be modified and run immediately.
   </p>

   <h2>Getting Gastona</h2>

   <p>
      The App for Android is available at the Google market for aproximately 1 Euro which represents
      a support for the project. It is also possible to download it for free and install it manually
      but then be sure to get gastona.apk from a official site!
   </p>

   <p>
      Binaries for both desktop and android can be found at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/gastona/">sourceforge.net/projects/gastona/</a>.
      If you want to contribute to its development, improvement etc or build a binary from the code
      you can fork the project from <a href="https://github.com/wakeupthecat/gastona">github.com/wakeupthecat/gastona</a>
   </p>
   <p>
      Finally the startup that wants to provide the best experience to all gastona users as well as
      create great related products is Wakeupthecat UG. Right now it is in a funding phase, so every one
      can be a part of it if! ... not for you ? sure ? ;)

   <h2>Gastona on Android</h2>

   <p>
      For desktop the way of running a gastona script is passing it as parameter to gastona.jar.
      But this is not a practical approach for an android App.
   </p>

   <h3>Directory /mnt/sdcard/gastona</h3>
   <p>
      This directory is where all gastona scripts (files with extension .gast) should be placed. It is possible
      to create sub directories inside of it if desired. Note that the directory and its files will remain after
      each Gastona update and also even if Gastona is uninstalled.
   </p>

   <p>
      So the first step to start running your scripts in Gastona is to create this directory. If you do it by
      pressing the button "Create gastona dir" some useful scripts will be copied to the directory as well.
   </p>

   <p>
      Some of the scripts belong to a mini tutorial and in particular three of them are actually
      powerful tools that makes the process of programming your android device easy.
   </p>

   <h3>/mnt/sdcard/gastona/autoStart.gast</h3>

   <p>
      Always Gastona App will execute this script if found. In its default version this script
      is a explorer and launcher of the rest of scripts in /mnt/sdcard/gastona. Since it is the
      start of all scripts it is recomended not to change it at the beginning unless you know how
      to restore it in case things don't work as expected.
   </p>

   <h3>File Ciervo</h3>

   <p>
      This, less than 200 lines script is an amazing File server. With it you can explore from
      your PC all files of your android device and also copy them to your PC (download).
   </p>

   <p>
      This script acts as a small http server so a connection, for example via WiFi, between your PC
      and your android device is needed. Also you need to know the IP address or the host name that
      the android device has in your network. Once you have all this:
   </p>

      <ul>
      <li> Launch File Ciervo on android</li>
      <li> Open a browser in your PC and introduce the url http://(android ip):7878</li>
      </ul>

   <p>
      Now the interesting part actually occurs in your browser where you can navigate through your android
      file structure. On your device you will see lost of messages. That just indicates the activity of
      the http command involved and it might be useful to check if the connection is doing well.
   </p>

   <h3>ProgramMe</h3>

   <p>
      This script also connects your android device with your PC in a similar way to File Ciervo.
      This time oriented to handle and transfer your gastona scripts from and to your android device!
      Once you have running ProgramMe on your android device connect to it from your browser 
      using the port 7676, then you can
   </p>
      <ul>
      <li> Load scripts from the android device into the browser (PC)</li>
      <li> Edit scripts directly in the browser</li>
      <li> Run scripts into the device from the browser</li>
      <li> Save scripts into the device from the browser</li>
      </ul>
   <p>
      That is, almost full controll of your scripts using a browser.
   </p>

   <h3>About obtaining the IP address</h3>

   <p>
      Depending on the network configuration it might be more or less difficult to get it. If available,
      the host name of the device in the network is more convenient than the IP since it will not change
      so you can store the final url in your browser favorites and connect the next time just with a click.
