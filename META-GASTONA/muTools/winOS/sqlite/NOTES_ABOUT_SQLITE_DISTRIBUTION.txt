====== ABOUT THE SQLITE BINARY DISTRIBUTED

The version of sqlite binary distributed here is 

   SQLite version 3.21.0 2017-10-24


SQLite has no license since is PUBLIC DOMAIN (actually the most generous license!)
   
   https://www.sqlite.org/copyright.html
   
   
====== GASTONA IMPLEMENTATION NEEDS SQLITE!

The use in Gastona of sqlite is mandatory (not optional!) since it is the native SQL support
of all commands that use it as well as widgets when the data source is a database.

It is important to provide a binary for all platforms

   Windows, Linux and Linux 64bit and RaspberryPi (ARM processor)

====== GASTONA ANDROID AND SQLITE

Unfortunatelly the approach of microTool cannot be used in Android due to
its execution permission policy. So, although a binary could be provided, it
actually cannot be launched. For that reason in gastona Android sqlite is 
accessed internally via the android sqlite provided API for java (unfortunately!).
