====== ABOUT THE RUBY BINARY DISTRIBUTED

The version of ruby binary distributed here is 
ruby 1.9.2p136 (2010-12-25 revision 30365) [i386-mswin32]

You can find sources of newest versions under

https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/

====== EXPERIMENTAL USE

The use in Gastona of Ruby, Perl and Lua binaries (Python was also planned)
is just experimental. 

It would be just very nice to have these excelent languages
embedded and available in all platforms for Gastona applications.
