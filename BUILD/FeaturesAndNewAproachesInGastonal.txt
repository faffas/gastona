- Notes about the many new approaches taken in gastona

   - Calling and deploying

         all in jar
            - by library files are searched in jar (images, text files etc)
            - MicroTool concept (unpack on demand)
            - AutoStart concept (allow easily deploying applications in a jar)
                autoStart.gast inserted in gastona.jar = new application (not anymore a script that depends on the installed gastona.jar version etc)
            - script fusion concept (like include but with 3 kinds of merge)
               allow localized customizations and changes without having to copy-paste

   - Eva:

         Uniform format for all script proposes and for more
         allows rapid development creating relaxed structures that later can be "hardtyped" (or not)
         load and save either from file or database

   - Mensaka:

         simple synchronous messaging with suscription
         data transmited via Eva Unit, very flexible and powerful
         can be implemented with lack of interfaces but it can be "interfaced" as needed

         cuasi blackboard data aproach (for widgets)
         Messaging is used by widgets but can be used for any class-to-class communication

   - DB

         - SQL integrated transparently
         - Easy database and table creation, making SQL useful for other tasks than only database apps
         - Windowing transparentely all SQL select queries (application does not need LIMIT to be efficient)
         - Table Connection schema concept (deep table, deep select)
         - Default database and default Temporary database

    - GUI

         - EvaLayout manager
         - new layout system with composition and relayouting concept (javaj) based on Eva structure
         - widget decoupling concept (see Mensaka), allow powerful widgets combined with easy use
         - Simplifyied and powerful table data model for many widgets
           with the added feature SQL

         specially powerful widgets:

         - Asiste widget Search filter and sorting using sql internally
         - Tree widget 1D aproach, facilitates creating trees with no effort plus having the
           search, filter capabilities (SQL)
              accepted limits:
                  - no dynamic loading for big trees (but they can be filtered instead)
                  - no folder data but only leaf data, still folders are selectables

   - Listix engine

         - Novel variable-procedure scripting concept with call-stack and loop table stack
         - Easy and powerful loops and sub-loops (Variable table / SQL / SCAN FILES / TEXT FILES etc)
         - Application caller and launcher
         - Generation of text files, code, sqls, command line arguments etc is straighforward

         specially powerful commands:

         - SCAN FILES into db
         - PARSE TEXT FILES using regular expressions into db (PARSONS)
         - PARSE XML into DB (XMELON)
         - PARSE JSON into Tables (JSON)
         - MICOHTTP (an amazing hppt server!)

   - NETWORK

         - An engine like listix being in origin a text generator armed with the HTTP protocoll becomes
           a powerful and easy to use http server that can be used not only as web server but for many
           application where the communication between devices is required.

   - Java connection is total (indeed it was designed as a java development helper)

      - dynamic class loader (but not de-loader :()
      - "static void" and "static String" functions can be called directly
      - to add new widget : a java class and declaring its name into the script
      - to add new listix command: a class and loading it in the script
      - controller: a class can be instanciated and react to messages or access the widgets directly

   - Other programs and tools connection

      - caller and parser can be used
      - due to the powerful generator, it is possible to easily generate perl or whatever script and
        call it
      - eva format can be used as exange format with apps developed in other languages
      - experimental commands RUBY, LUA and PERL. Currently only in PC version for windows :(

   - Log concept

         - Log switchable to on by creating the folder "sessionLog" or by specifying the log folder in script
         - Levels of messages: PANIC, FATAL, SEVERE, ERROR and 10 debug levels
         - selectable per source and level activation of logs
         - log on database (text file with sql inserts)
         - basic general log (time stamp, etc) and custom logs (specific tables)
         - generate database with extra schema (tables connected)
         - total sql activity dumped
         - call stack dumped on serious errors and listix and Mensaka stacks on normal errors
         - optimized source info detection using reflection
         - easy to use for the sources (java classes)

         - not yet implemented, but from the data logged automatic session reports
           and graphics (e.g. graphwiz) can be generated i.e. for message and logic execution flow, etc
