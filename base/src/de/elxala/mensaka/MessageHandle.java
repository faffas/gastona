/**
   Handle to identify the message. At the moment it just contains an index to be used directly by
   Mensaka methods but in the future (when removing messages with no subscribers might be allowed)
   it can be used to check if the handle is still valid.

   Using handles to send a message is not a must since it is still possible to use the method
   Mensaka.sendMessage (String), but it is convenient for three reasons: it is suposed to be faster
   (not need to search the message as string), produces a cleaner code (not repeating
   string constants that may produce typo errors) and might be better "protocolled": when a controller
   use MessageHandle it calls the method Mensaka.declare, thus at this moment the source and the
   message it might send is known and it is not needed to wait for the message to get this information.

   Another important reason is that any system (e.g. listix or a general controller) might send messages just using a string.

      information set and required by Mensaka

            - mskMessageText
                  message of the text needed to assign and reassign if needed the mskMenssageIndex

            - mskMenssageIndex
                  index assignable only by Mensaka!
                  if != -1 then there is a valid message in the intern list of messages of Mensaka
                  NOTE: mensaka might or might not assign a valid message index for "lost messages"
                        (messages with no listeners at the moment of sending the message)
                        It is not right to assume that after Mensaka.declare we obtain a valid message index

            - mskEraseEpoch
                  Mensaka has an increasing counter to reflect the time of deletions of its internal list
                  of messages. At the moment of assigning a msgMensakaIndex to a handle Mensaka also stamps
                  this internal counter into eraseEpoch of the handle. This way it is possible for mensaka
                  to delete messages of its list without informing all handles about it but invalidating
                  them, that is

                     if (handle.eraseEpoch != currentEraseEpoch)
                        // handle.mskMenssageIndex is invalid! and has to be assigned again using the mskMessageText
                     else
